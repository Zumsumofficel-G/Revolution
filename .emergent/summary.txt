<analysis>
The previous AI engineer effectively navigated a complex, evolving set of requirements for the Revolution Roleplay FiveM server application. The approach involved rapid MVP development, iteratively adding features based on user feedback, and prioritizing critical functionalities. Initially, the focus was on establishing the core application with server statistics, application forms, and an admin panel. A key decision was to use bulk file writes for initial setup to quickly deliver an aha moment. Subsequent iterations addressed Discord integration (OAuth, role-based access, message display), followed by a shift away from Discord login to a custom admin-managed user system with staff roles. The engineer consistently used screenshots for visual validation and a deep testing agent for comprehensive system checks. Syntax errors and architectural missteps (like overwriting files) were identified and corrected. The final phase introduced advanced features: application-specific staff permissions, user management (edit credentials), Discord news feed, and changelog system. The engineer adeptly handled external API interactions (FiveM, Discord) and user clarification requests, demonstrating a robust problem-solving trajectory.

<product_requirements>
The user requested a website for their FiveM server, Revolution Roleplay.
**Initial Requirements:**
1.  **Admin Panel:** Secure login for administrators.
2.  **Application Management:** Admins can create various application forms.
3.  **Public Application Page:** Users can view available applications and apply (showing name, application type, and a link to the form).
4.  **Discord Webhooks:** Staff can choose which webhook an application response is sent to upon creation.
5.  **Server Statistics:** Display live player count from .
6.  **Branding:** Incorporate provided logo and banner.
**Evolving Requirements & Enhancements:**
7.  **Discord Integration (Initial):** Display messages from Discord channel , implement Discord OAuth login, role-based admin panel access (role  on server ). Users without admin role see a personal dashboard (name, logo, sent applications, status).
8.  **Discord Login Removal:** Remove Discord login option, retaining only the existing admin login system. Ensure Discord messages and webhooks still function.
9.  **Custom User Management:** Admin can create logins for staff users with limited access to manage submitted applications.
10. **Discord Message Display Refinement:** Fix file attached messages to show proper content if available (later updated to show Medie delt for media), remove the Seneste kanal beskeder box.
11. **Admin User Management Enhancements:** Admin can view and manage all created users (edit roles, delete users).
12. **Login Back Button:** Add a Back to homepage button on the admin login page.
13. **Advanced User & Application Permissions:** Admin can assign specific application forms to staff users, enabling staff to manage only those forms. This must auto-update when new forms are created.
14. **Admin Credential Management:** Admins can edit usernames and passwords for existing users.
15. **Changelog System:** Implement a system for admins to add and manage changelogs, displayed on the homepage.
16. **Discord News (Re-introduction):** Display news from Discord channel  again, showing Medie delt for media.

<current_work>
The Revolution Roleplay website is currently a full-stack application with a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB database. It has undergone significant development, evolving from a basic application form portal to a sophisticated platform with a robust role-based user management system.

**Current state of the product:**
*   **Public-facing website:** Displays live FiveM server statistics (player count) and a dynamic Ansøg Nu (Apply Now) section with links to various application forms.
*   **Discord News Feed:** A dedicated section now fetches and displays messages from a specified Discord channel (), with special handling for media attachments (showing Medie delt). This feed auto-updates.
*   **Changelog System:** A Seneste Ændringer (Latest Changes) section is visible, displaying changelogs managed by admins.
*   **Application System:** Users can directly apply for positions without requiring a login. Submissions trigger Discord webhook notifications.
*   **Admin/Staff Login:** A dedicated admin login page is available. This page now includes a Tilbage til forsiden (Back to homepage) button for user convenience.
*   **Role-Based User Management:**
    *   **Admin Role:** Users with the 'admin' role (e.g., 'admin/admin123') have full access to all four dashboard tabs: Oversigt (Overview), Ansøgninger (Applications - for creating forms), Indsendte Ansøgninger (Submitted Applications), and Indstillinger (Settings). Admins can create new application forms, manage all submitted applications, and crucially, create and manage other users (both admin and staff), including editing their usernames and passwords.
    *   **Staff Role:** Users with the 'staff' role have limited access, seeing only two tabs: Oversigt and Indsendte Ansøgninger. They *cannot* create application forms or manage user settings. They *can* view and manage submitted applications, and their access to specific application forms can be precisely controlled by admins.
*   **Backend Security:** All API endpoints are protected with role-based authentication, ensuring that users can only access functionalities permitted by their role. For example, staff users are blocked from admin-only endpoints.

The system is fully functional according to the latest requirements, providing a streamlined experience for public users and a powerful management interface for administrators and staff.
